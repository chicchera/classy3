I see. You want to download many ebooks at once, instead of one by one. That's understandable, as it can save you a lot of time and effort. Fortunately, there are some websites that offer bulk downloads of free ebooks in English. Here are some of them:

- [Standard Ebooks](^11^): This website provides free and liberated ebooks, carefully produced for the true book lover. You can download collections of different categories of ebooks, such as adventure, children, fantasy, horror, mystery, romance, science fiction, etc. You can also download the entire catalog of over 600 ebooks in one zip file. The ebooks are available in epub, azw3, kepub and epub3 formats.
- [Open Culture](^10^): This website has a collection of over 800 free ebooks for your Kindle, iPad/iPhone, computer, smartphone or ereader. You can download great works of fiction, non-fiction and poetry, including works by Asimov, Austen, Dickens, Fitzgerald, Gaiman, Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Shakespeare, Hemingway, Woolf, Joyce and more. You can also browse by author or genre. The ebooks are mostly in epub or pdf formats, but some are also in mobi or html formats.
- [Internet Archive](^4^): This website is a digital library of free and borrowable books, movies, music and more. You can download over 20 million ebooks from various sources, such as Project Gutenberg, Google Books, Library of Congress, etc. You can also search by keywords, subjects, collections, creators, languages, etc. The ebooks are available in various formats, such as epub, mobi, pdf, txt, etc. You can also use the advanced search option to filter by media type, file extension, date, etc.

I hope this helps you with your project. Good luck! ðŸ˜Š
