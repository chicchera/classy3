### Calibre ebook-convert

Use [Calibre ebook-convert](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/generated/en/ebook-convert.html) instead

You can use the `ebook-convert` command-line tool, which is part of the Calibre ebook management software, to convert various ebook formats to text. To do this, you'll need to run the `ebook-convert` tool from your Python script. Here's how you can achieve this:

First, make sure you have Calibre installed on your system.

Here's a Python script that demonstrates how to use `ebook-convert` to convert an ebook file to text:

```python
import subprocess

# Replace 'input.ebook' with the path to your input ebook file
input_ebook = 'input.ebook'

# Replace 'output.txt' with the path where you want to save the converted text
output_text = 'output.txt'

# Run the ebook-convert command
try:
    subprocess.run(['ebook-convert', input_ebook, output_text])
    print(f"Conversion successful. Text saved to {output_text}")
except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

In this script:

1. Replace `'input.ebook'` with the path to your input ebook file, and `'output.txt'` with the path where you want to save the converted text.

2. The `subprocess.run()` function is used to run the `ebook-convert` command with the input ebook file and the desired output text file. If the conversion is successful, it will save the text to the specified output file.

3. If there is an error during conversion, it will be captured and printed.

Make sure the `ebook-convert` tool is in your system's PATH so that the script can find and run it. Additionally, Calibre should be installed on your system for `ebook-convert` to work.

This script allows you to convert ebook formats to text using the Calibre `ebook-convert` tool and save the resulting text to a file.

### Pros and Cons: libs vs external tool

The choice between using Python libraries like PyPDF2, EbookLib, and python-docx or using a versatile tool like `ebook-convert` from Calibre depends on your specific needs and requirements. Here are some factors to consider:

1. **Control and Customization:** If you need fine-grained control over the conversion process, especially if you want to manipulate the content of the ebook files before or after conversion, using Python libraries like PyPDF2 for PDFs or EbookLib for various ebook formats can be a good choice. You can write custom scripts to perform specific tasks on the content.

2. **Integration:** If you're building a larger software system that needs to interact with ebook files and perform various operations as part of a broader application, using Python libraries gives you the flexibility to integrate ebook handling directly into your application.

3. **Complexity:** Working with low-level Python libraries may require more effort and coding compared to using `ebook-convert`, which is a ready-made tool. If you prefer a more straightforward and quick solution, `ebook-convert` might be a better option.

4. **Ebook Formats:** `ebook-convert` is a powerful tool that supports a wide range of ebook formats. However, if you have very specific requirements or need to handle less common or proprietary formats, you might need to use specialized libraries for those formats.

5. **User Interface:** If you need a command-line tool for batch processing, `ebook-convert` is convenient. If you want to build a GUI or provide a user-friendly interface, using Python libraries will allow you to create a custom interface tailored to your needs.

6. **Efficiency:** Depending on the size and complexity of the files you're working with, the performance and memory usage of both approaches may differ. You might want to consider performance implications when choosing between the two.

In summary, if you have specific needs for your ebook handling, want more control, and are willing to invest in coding, Python libraries like PyPDF2, EbookLib, and python-docx can be a good choice. If you prefer a quicker and more straightforward solution or need a command-line tool for simple conversions, `ebook-convert` from Calibre is a practical option. The choice should align with your project's goals and your level of technical expertise.

## Tools

### Temporary dirs/files

To create a temporary directory in a platform-independent way and ensure that it's deleted with all its contents, you can use the `tempfile` module. The `tempfile` module provides a cross-platform way to create temporary directories and files. Here's how you can use it:

```python
import tempfile
import shutil

def create_temp_directory():
    # Create a temporary directory
    temp_dir = tempfile.mkdtemp()

    return temp_dir

def clean_temp_directory(temp_dir):
    # Delete the temporary directory and its contents
    shutil.rmtree(temp_dir, ignore_errors=True)

# Example of using the functions:
try:
    # Create a temporary directory
    temp_dir = create_temp_directory()

    # Work with the temporary directory
    # ...

    # When done, clean up the directory
    clean_temp_directory(temp_dir)
except Exception as e:
    # Handle any exceptions
    print(f"Error: {e}")
    # Clean up the directory in case of an error
    clean_temp_directory(temp_dir)
```

In this code:

1. `create_temp_directory()` creates a temporary directory using `tempfile.mkdtemp()`. This directory will be unique and platform-independent.

2. `clean_temp_directory(temp_dir)` is used to delete the temporary directory and its contents. The `shutil.rmtree` function is used for this purpose. We pass `ignore_errors=True` to ensure that it won't raise an error if the directory doesn't exist.

3. In your program, you can create the temporary directory, perform your work, and then call `clean_temp_directory` to ensure it's deleted.

4. In the event of an error, the temporary directory is also cleaned up.

This code should provide you with a reliable way to manage temporary directories and ensure they are deleted, regardless of the platform you're working on.

### Infer the type of file

You're correct that processing large files with wildcards and regular expressions can be slow, especially if the files are several megabytes in size. To improve performance and efficiently infer the type of file, you can follow a different approach by examining only a portion of the file, such as the first 10K bytes, as you suggested.

Here's an updated approach:

```python
import re
import glob

def has_extensions(text: str) -> bool:
    return bool(re.search(r'\.\w+', text))

def has_file_path(text: str) -> bool:
    return bool(re.search(r'(\w:/|/|\w:\\)', text))

# Your list to store lines from files
lines_list = []

# Process your input files one by one
input_files = ["file1.txt", "file2.txt", "path/to/files/*.txt"]  # Add your file paths or patterns

def process_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            if has_extensions(line) or has_file_path(line):
                lines_list.append(line)

for input_file in input_files:
    # Check if the input_file is a wildcard pattern
    if '*' in input_file or '?' in input_file:
        matching_files = glob.glob(input_file)
        for file_path in matching_files:
            process_file(file_path)
    else:
        # Process a single file
        process_file(input_file)

# Now lines_list contains lines from both individual files and files matching wildcards
```

In this updated approach:

1. We have a `process_file` function that reads and processes a file line by line, similar to your initial code.

2. We check if the input file matches a wildcard pattern and process all matching files accordingly, using the `process_file` function.

3. For individual files, we also use the `process_file` function to read and process them.

This approach efficiently processes files by only examining a portion of each file. If a file is very large, it only processes the first part, which should help avoid performance issues.

### CSV output

Certainly, using a predefined list of headers is a valid and practical shortcut, especially for ease of maintenance. This approach ensures that your CSV headers are consistent and easily modifiable. You can define the headers separately, and then if you update your data structure, you won't need to modify the headers each time.

Here's how you can use predefined headers in your code:

```python
import csv

# Define the file name for your CSV
csv_file_name = "book_data.csv"

# Define the headers for your CSV
headers = ["Title", "Paragraphs", "Sentences_Per_Paragraph", "Words_Per_Sentence"]

# Your book data with potentially varying keys
book_data = [
    {"Title": "Book 1", "Paragraphs": 10},
    {"Title": "Book 2", "Sentences_Per_Paragraph": 4},
]

# Open the CSV file in write mode and write the headers
with open(csv_file_name, mode="w", newline='') as csv_file:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(csv_file, fieldnames=headers)
    writer.writeheader()

    # Write the data for each book
    for book in book_data:
        writer.writerow(book)
```

With this approach, you have a clear separation between your headers and data, making it easier to update or maintain your program in the future. If you add or remove keys from your data dictionaries, you only need to update the `headers` list accordingly.
